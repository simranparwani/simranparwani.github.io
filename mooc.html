			<p>For a project for the UX Course at Steinhardt, we were tasked with designing a platform for elearning. Our first step was conducting heuristic evaluations and task analyses of popular elearning platforms like Coursera and Udacity. Then, we created lo-fi prototypes and our hi-fi.

			<p>For this stage, I created a paper prototype. This stage was really helpful for me in conceiving how the user could interact with the platform by sketching each page out. However, I think I would gleaned more useful user feedback had I gone through an intermediate stage of prototyping by transferring these sketches into a lo-fi digital prototype or done a more elaborate paper prototype with color and easy transitions. Because speed is so critical to flow and interactivity, the fact that I was shuffling papers for each page transition made it difficult for the user tester to envision the design of the platform and the interactions. I did however learn from user testing that I needed to eliminate certain features, like browsing posts by top poster, to make the interaction more streamlined.

			<p>Adding interactivity to the prototype added a whole new dimension to design. Beyond thinking about the way elements looked, I had to think about how they interacted with each other and how the user interacted with them. It was so easy to forget to link elements and I found that I had to test my prototype five times to make sure that everything was linked correctly and even that might prove to not be enough. Through user testing in class, the feedback I got was that the colors used were really approachable and friendly, that the platform was very simple and straightforward, and the design was clean and minimalist. It was reassuring to hear that these users felt what I had hoped to accomplish through the design. In tracking where the users clicked through the page, I found that my navigation was clear for those two users at least. I tried to ask more specific questions to hear some negative feedback, but I wasn’t able to achieve this in the user interviews. This project taught me that how you present your project is really important.

			<p>Overall, I think my design accomplished its goal of being personalized and easy to navigate. I had been quite unsure about the colors, but during user testing, my group members kept praising the color scheme of the platform, saying that it made the product look more approachable. Some other feedback I got was that the design was clean and fun, so it was reaffirming to hear that the design conveyed what I wanted it to. However, I wish I had prepared my platform more for user testing. For the lo-fi prototype, I didn’t glean as much useful feedback because my prototype didn’t convey what was in my head. Instead, it offered a very limited perspective, hampered by the lack of color and the clear interaction since I just shuffled papers for page transitions. I tried to ask specific questions during hi-fi prototype testing to get constructive feedback, such as “can you do this task?”, “how do you feel about this layout?”, “how would you do it differently?”, etc. but did not really get any good feedback for making improvements.</p>

The challenging part was balancing tradeoffs. For instance, what my prototype gained in being simple and straightforward also made it have less sophisticated user interfaces. For instance, the search and sort and filter features have less capabilities than other marketplace UIs and the class discussion/inbox pages lose more complex functionalities. Additionally, I found it difficult to balance providing as much information to the user as possible while still maintaining an aesthetic balance and also not overwhelming the user. I remember feeling overwhelmed by there being too many confusing choices on EdX and I hoped to avoid that same fate with this platform. Another thing I found difficult about this project was being creative as silly as that sounds. The widespread use of apps and web has led to a certain expectation for how an interface is designed. People have learned how to use a credit card checkout interface and a sign-up form. Though there are certain small changes you can make, I found it difficult to reinvent the wheel because deviations from traditional UI layouts can make the user confused and would require more user testing than was in the scope of this project. </p>
<p>

I don’t think there was an easy part to this project...even somewhat simple things like color took me a few tries to find a balance I liked and conveyed what I wanted to the user. Though I used Figma before, this was the first project I’ve had that required a lot of interaction and I found that things like checkboxes and sliders and horizontal transitions (for the quotes) were not supported immediately. Thus, I would have liked to allot more time to figuring out how to make that functionality around the technical restrictions. I definitely became a lot better with Figma, which was great because, last week, I saw the designers at my software engineering internship using Figma and I was able to have a good conversation with them about design and learn how to foster better developer-designer relations within a team. I definitely would start earlier next time and make time to get all the parts of the website functional like the “how it works” page or the languages. Additionally, some of the pages look quite bland and sparse and I would have liked to create some illustrations for them. Overall, I learned a lot and also learned how much I have left to learn!
