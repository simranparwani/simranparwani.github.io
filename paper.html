	<h1>Capstone Reflection Paper</h1>
	<em>Feel free to view this essay in word document form <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ok9ya_q5HAdqwfJqfmsrAOURl3t-N7meRjlejYRgow/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a></em>
	<br/><br/>
	<h3>Motivation</h3>
	<p>It is hard to be an activist at my university. Given the landscape around us, typical forms of activism, like rallies or sit-ins, are forbidden and less visible forms of activism are closely monitored by the administration. At the onset of my senior year, I felt frustrated by certain facets of NYU Abu Dhabi from its failure to decolonize its learning environment to the lack of academic multidisciplinarity. Given that it was my last year at this university, operating from a place of care for the community, I hoped to channel my frustration into creating change. Around this time, I was beginning my formal capstone research which introduced me to two frameworks: Data Humanism, an approach linking data to people, and Data Feminism, a set of principles that apply an intersectional feminist lens to data. In tandem, these concepts opened the possibility of using data to challenge power and increase understanding. Amidst this inspiration and my own anger, I questioned: could I use visualization as a form of activism? </p>


	<p>This speculation began my capstone journey into data visualization and using data to challenge power. I situate my research in the intersection of Data Humanism and Data Feminism. Using these frameworks, I examined existing visualization projects to guide my work and built prototypes exploring various ways of interpreting data. Through my capstone research, I produced a body of work that challenges hierarchical structures and uses visualization to increase readers’ understanding in order to build a culture of community data activism.</p>
</div>

<div class="step" data-step="2">
	<h3>Research</h3>
	<h5>Data Humanism</h5>
	<p>My capstone research formally began with someone who had long inspired me: Giorgia Lupi, an Italian data visualization designer and Pentagram partner. She popularized Data Humanism, a concept that challenges the way we view data (“Data Humanism”). Instead of seeing data as a truth to help us optimize profit, efficiency, and other metrics, she regards data as a subjective and imperfect medium to help us understand our own humanity (see fig 1). </p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="3">


	<p>In her project with artist Stephanie Posavec, Dear Data, she demonstrates this concept for working with data. In this project, Posavec and Lupi collected data on one aspect of their lives each week, such as the number of times they said thank you or their use of transportation. They presented this data on hand-drawn visualizations sent on the back of a postcard that they mailed each other each week (see fig 2). The postcards took a week to arrive, challenging the idea that data must be transmitted as efficiently as possible. They began the project as mere acquaintances, exploring whether they could get to know each other through these visualizations (they are now close friends). In this way, they demonstrated that people could “use data to become more humane and connect with [them]selves and others at a deeper level” (Lupi xi). </p>
	<p>The visual intricacy of her visualizations are designed for the reader to explore at their own pace and interest. She describes this process as nonlinear storytelling, a way for the user to “[explore] individual elements, minor tales and larger trends within the greater visualization, while being naturally invited to engage with the visual on deeper levels” (“Data Humanism”). Through designing visualizations for nonlinear storytelling, a maker can increase understanding about and empathy for the people and issues represented visually. 
</p>

</div>

<div class="step" data-step="4">
	<p>Lupi’s work taught me that visualizations can be playful and expressive, departing from the usual bar graphs and pie charts I’d encountered thus far. Inspired by her work, my early prototyping explored Data Humanism and nonlinear storytelling. I built a force directed bubble graph representing the consolidation of newspaper ownership in my home state of Ohio. The next iteration of this visualization explored guiding the reader through the visualization before letting them navigate the graph at their own pace. These prototypes heightened my awareness about how the viewer is guided through a visualization. Lupi’s work and my early experiments revealed the possibility of creating visualizations that the viewer could engage with more profoundly. My body of work draws on these sources of knowledge to create expressive visualizations with nonlinear storytelling that invites the reader to spend time interacting with individual elements. In doing so, data becomes a medium for a greater understanding of the community issues discussed. </p>
</div>

<div class="step" data-step="5">
<h5>Data Feminism</h5>
<p>In my early research, I stumbled upon <em>Data Feminism</em>, a book authored by MIT professor and artist Catherine D’Ignazio and Emory professor Lauren Klein. This book gave me a path forward from my doubts about data science, introducing me to ways I could think more critically about data and use it as a tool. Two principles of Data Feminism are especially relevant to my capstone research: “Elevate emotion and embodiment” and “Examine power” (D’Ignazio, introduction).
</p>
<p>“Elevate emotion and embodiment” is to acknowledge the editorial decisions a data visualization practitioner makes to embrace emotion and embodiment as part of the knowledge imparted from a visualization. This principle challenges the binary of emotion and logic and accepts that visualizations are never objective (D’Ignazio, ch 3).
</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="6">
<p>In 2013, data visualization firm Periscopic released a visualization of the number of stolen years due to gun violence in the US (Periscopic). Alberto Cairo, one of the foremost data visualization practitioners, questioned whether the piece was “clear to a general audience that what they see is the work of professionals who actively shape data to support a cause, and not the product of automated processes?” (Cairo). The Periscopic piece came into such scrutiny because of its metric of ‘stolen years’, the inclusion of the names of individuals killed, and the gripping audio; these depart from the pretense of objectivity and minimalism so entrenched in the data visualization field (see fig 3). D’Ignazio and Klein criticize this facade in their book <em>Data Feminism</em>, arguing that Cairo and other practitioners’ concerns with neutrality stem from the long gendered binary of emotion and reason. Given the editorial choices practitioners make in titles, annotations, and color, as well as the decisions in analyzing and including certain subsets of data, D’Ignazio and Klein believe visualization is inherently subjective. They view the Periscopic visualization as “a statement of profound truth revealed to us through our own emotions” (D’Ignazio Ch 3). The Periscopic visualization, in its success of showing the impact of gun violence in the US, becomes a case study for how the editorial choices of visualization designers impact audience understanding and empathy.
</p>
</div>

<div class="step" data-step="7">
	<p>The project, <em>One Amongst Many</em>, was created by data visualization engineer Shirley Wu and her collaborators to showcase the contributions of women in computing since they’ve largely been invisible in history (see fig 5). This project integrates emotion and embodiment through the way the user experiences the data. Each orb in the installation represents a woman in computing where the position of the orb corresponds to the year of their greatest accomplishment and the height corresponds to their influence. As the user touches the orb, it becomes brighter, conveying how this woman’s history has been increasingly illuminated (Bremer, ch 5). Inspired by this project, I hoped to highlight the influence of the women who won Nobel Prizes in 2020. I built an LED lightshow with a few variables: the color represented the prize category and the speed of light represented the number of views on these women’s Wikipedia pages. This prototype wasn’t particularly effective as it was difficult to truly understand the miniscule differences in light speed, but the prototype taught me that I wanted to center marginalized communities in my work as much as possible and to be mindful of how the user experiences a visualization.</p>

</div>
<div class="step" data-step="8">
	<p>The other Data Feminism principle that informs my capstone research is “examine power” (D’Ignazio, ch 2). I initially felt apprehensive about data visualization as a medium given that data has often been used as a method of surveillance and control on non-white and non-male presenting bodies. The Data Feminism framework introduced me to counterdata, where marginalized communities take it upon themselves to fill in the gaps of institutional data (D’Ignazio, ch 1). In doing so, they reclaim control of data and use it as a tool of empowerment. A counterdata project referenced in Data Feminism that applies the principle of “examine power” particularly inspired me. This project, led by community organizer Gwendolyn Warren in 1971, wanted to record the number of occurrences of commuters running over Black children in downtown Detroit. The records of these deaths were not collected by any institution, so Warren worked with Black youth to fill in the gaps in the institutional data (D’Ignazio, ch 2). Using this data, Warren created a powerful visualization showing where and how often Black children were hit by commuters see fig 6). This Data Feminism principle of examining power and this project inspired the spirit of my capstone where I hoped that my data visualization research would challenge hierarchical structures and/or highlight a missing dataset at the institutional level. 
</p>

	<p>These two Data Feminism principles increased my awareness of how data can be used as a tool for activism. They also reminded me to be mindful of the effect of my design and navigation decisions on the interpretation of a visualization.</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="9">
	<h3>Design Intent</h3>
	<p>Using Data Humanism and Data Feminism as guiding theoretical frameworks, these data visualization works and my own early prototypes informed the body of work I produced this year. I draw upon Data Humanism and the “Elevate Emotion and Embodiment” principle of Data Feminism to help me develop visualizations that increase readers’ understanding of the issues I discuss. Inspired by the Data Feminism principle, “Examine power,” my work shifts the ownership and interpretation of data to the community. Given the communal-nature of my process, I chose to share the work produced in The Gazelle, the University’s independent publication, given that it is meant to reflect campus climate and tones in the community. Additionally, the high viewership of the publication would allow my work to reach a large audience and get feedback. Halfway through the year, given the impact of my work published until that point and the publication management’s demand for more interactive, data-driven pieces like mine, I realized the importance of continuing these community counterdata projects beyond my graduation. To train and mentor other students to take on this work, I built the Data Team at the Gazelle, a group of four Data Editors and me. This added an additional dimension to my capstone project, of creating a culture of community data activism where any student could create their own counterdata project while increasing the data literacy of our community.</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="10">
	<h3>Production</h3>
	<h5 id="ref1">Piece 1: Is Blue Mart Overpriced? A Comparative Look At Prices Across The UAE</h5>
	<p>Last summer, the NYUAD student stipend policy changed, giving students 50% of their finances in campus dirhams. This policy change increased dependence on campus vendors, a fact difficult to reconcile given their notoriously high prices. The high prices of the NYUAD campus convenience store were an unspoken truth in our community; students knew the prices were more expensive than those at other grocery stores, but we didn’t have any indisputable proof to show the administration. Amidst this campus climate, I aimed to produce a data storytelling piece to demonstrate the repercussions of this policy change on students’ consumer power.</p>
	<p>Inspired by the counterdata projects I examined in my research, I produced a data visualization piece and counterdata project that made the high prices at the campus convenience store visible. I began considering the questions I had: How do the convenience store prices compare to those at other grocery stores in the region? How do the prices at the  convenience store, operated by Blue Mart, compare to other Blue Mart stores? After talking to students about this prospective project, I learned what information would be valuable from their perspectives. How much money are students losing a semester due to their campus convenience store purchases? How much is a campus dirham worth in terms of a UAE dirham? These conversations made me realize the importance of including community members in the planning of a data activism project and would go on to become an important step in my methodology for future pieces. </p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="11">
	<p>In Data Feminism, practitioners are encouraged to accept the editorial choices they make in their visualization; some key decisions I made focused on color and navigation through the piece In the first graphic in the piece, I created a dot chart showing the differences in price for the same product at the campus convenience store, Lulu, and Carrefour. I chose to use the colors purple, green, and blue for each brand respectively given their branding colors in order for the reader to make an easier association between the dot symbol and the entity it represents. I also categorized each grocery product into a grouping like “Noodles” and “Bakery.” Without this subjective decision, all 82 products would have been displayed on the same chart, overwhelming the reader and making it difficult to gain insight from the visualization.</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="12">
	<p>I also wanted to know how many products are X percent greater at the campus convenience store, so I calculated the percent difference of each product between the campus convenience store and Carrefour. I originally intended to visualize the data through a vertical histogram, but realized this misled the reader into thinking every product was more expensive at the campus convenience store (see fig 8).</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="13">

	<p>While my editor wanted me to keep the original histogram due to clarity, I chose to prioritize accuracy and published the second visualization taking into account the direction of the percent difference (see fig 9). This helped me create an order of priorities in making visualizations, ranking accuracy above ease of understanding.</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="14">
	<p>In the final interactive graphic of the article, I hoped to heighten the users’ understanding of the prices by having them experience the effects of the data, applying the Data Feminism principle “elevate emotion and embodiment.” Thus, I built a shopping cart game in which the reader selected and purchased products from our campus store, experiencing the difference in price from another grocery store (see fig 10). I originally designed the experience to be “drag and drop” where the reader would drag items into their shopping carts. However, I realized that this interaction was much more difficult to create on a mobile and used clicking instead. One disadvantage of sharing through The Gazelle was the strict deadlines for publishing...I felt unhappy with the aesthetic of the shopping cart game, but had to complete it by a certain time, forcing me to prioritize functionality over well-written code and professional design, especially when viewed on a range of devices.</p>
	<p>The response to the shopping cart game was overwhelmingly enthusiastic. “My mom in Texas played with the shopping cart for 30 minutes,” a person in my year told me. “I can’t believe how little I think about this,” another student told me, describing how the game increased her awareness of her own consumer power. The game allowed the reader to embody the experience of shopping at the campus convenience store; immediately seeing a receipt with their financial loss demonstrated the impact of these price disparities, making this loss in consumer power no longer abstract. The user feedback I received indicated that the game experience increased the audience’s understanding of, and their emotional connection with, the issue of campus vendors. Through this piece, I showed how integrating embodiment into visualization fostered greater understanding of the impact this campus vendor issue has in our community.</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="15">
	<h5 id="ref2">Piece 2: How Flexible is Your Major?</h5>
	<p>This piece questioned whether NYUAD lives up to its promise of a new model of education by examining the flexibility and multidisciplinarity of the university’s academic programs. My investigation began by speaking with my peers about how they interpreted academic flexibility, giving me context surrounding the data. I scraped course information including its cross-listings from the NYUAD student portal, building a sample of courses offered more than once since Spring 2018 and not exclusively as a J-term course.</p>
	<p>I wanted the reader to explore the cross-listings at their own pace, integrating Lupi’s principle of nonlinear storytelling. </p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="16">
	<p>I originally intended to build an arc diagram, but the large sample size would make it difficult to understand (see fig 11).</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="17">
<p> I decided to build a sunburst diagram given the hierarchical levels of the data, adding a filter by major so the reader could also immediately find what they wanted (see fig 12). Having both a filter for immediate analysis and space for reader exploration seemed to work effectively...in user testing, students seemed to first filter for their own major(s) of interest and then explore the rest of the visualization at their own pace.</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="18">
<p>The third graphic, a violin plot, was designed to show the distribution of courses’ number of cross-listings. Since this chart was the most statistically advanced visualization I had produced for The Gazelle thus far, I showed the chart to user testers from a range of backgrounds and levels of comfort with statistics. The user testing revealed the need for more explanatory text about what the chart represented; thus, I included a more in-depth footer than usual (see fig 13).</p>
</div>

<div class="step" data-step="19">
	<p>For the final graphic, I wanted to demonstrate the cross-listings of the most flexible courses. Inspired by Lupi’s style, I built a visualization to show the connections between a course and its cross-listings (see fig 14). While the reader could see the number of cross-listings these courses had, they had to individually examine elements to get more information about the cross-listing. I originally intended to place each course in a grid of rows, but had difficulties maintaining clarity with a smaller space allocated for each course. I decided to just display each course individually and use a dropdown to select a particular course.</p>
	<p>After sharing my piece, I received positive feedback. A data visualization student from another university commented: “I was so floored by the sunburst cross listing!!! I think it is so rare to see an effective application of a circle based chart.” A student I’ve never spoken to before said, “I am so impressed by your Gazelle articles.” Other students messaged responses like “Just...wow,” “This is amazing! Congratulations,” and “You’re incredible.” While it was nice to hear kind words from my peers, I felt concerned that I was not getting much expert critical feedback from within the community, revealing a gap of data literacy within our community.</p>
	<p>This growing realization was accompanied by the demand from the publication’s management for more interactive data pieces and an increase in students reaching out to ask for insight as to how to complete similar projects. Given these factors, I hoped to expand this project of community data activism in integrating more members from the community in the production process.</p>
</div>

<div class="step" data-step="20">
	<h5 id="ref3">Piece 3 Where do NYUAD Faculty Obtain Their Degrees?</h5>
	<p>Amidst the greater demand for a decolonized learning environment, I aimed to explore faculty diversity. Given the lack of institutional data on this, I focused on our faculty’s institutions of education, analyzing at the level of education and country. After talking to students, I learned to be mindful of differences in institutions within countries. </p>

</div>
<div class="step" data-step="21">
	<p>I also selected two students interested in this issue to work with me on this piece, training them in scraping data and building data visualizations. This style of collaboration felt blissful in comparison to the isolated environment I had in the previous semester. While I would make the ultimate decisions in working with data and choosing how to visualize it, getting input from other data-literate people made me more comfortable in producing the work. This input was also helpful in helping me be aware of the gaps in my own knowledge due to my positionality.</p>
	<p>Based on the principles of nonlinear storytelling, each visualization produced in this piece tried to create complex narratives that the reader could peruse. For the first visualization, I elected to use a chloropleth map to make the geographic distribution of power more visible, such that readers could see the concentration of faculty education in the Global North (see fig 15). </p>
</div>

<div class="step" data-step="22">
	<p>For the second graphic, I wanted to show movement between countries given the pattern of faculty doing their Bachelor’s in their home countries but moving to the US/Europe for subsequent degrees. I thought a sankey (multi-step alluvial) diagram would be effective in showing the flow of movement (see fig 16). Reflecting on this visualization, I think it could have been improved by labelling the columns with the levels of education, using a pop-up to indicate the full name of the country rather than relying on the two letter abbreviation in the label, and including a filter rather than using a horizontal scroll for examining individual academic divisions. </p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="23">
	<p>To not erase differences in institutions within a country, I wanted to include an additional graphic that showed the representation of institutions by country and representation of institutions within a country. I originally intended to build out a proportional area chart, but found that it would be difficult to compare the first level of representation of countries in the data. Thus, I decided to use a hierarchical tree map that could compare both levels (see fig 17). </p>
	<p>In user testing, readers spent over 5 minutes examining each visualization, suggesting that these visualizations offered enough meaning and space for exploration. This piece received a lot of attention, likely because our team began sharing our work more widely on various social media platforms. One NYUAD professor retweeted it, writing “The data team on this year's  @TheGazelleAD staff continues to deliver the goods.” The piece was included in some campus newsletters and one professor included the piece as mandatory reading for his class--it felt surreal to be cited as “Parwani et al.” on a class syllabus. The student feedback we got included comments like “It’s a brilliant article they put a lot of effort in! Also, the visualizations are AMAZING!”, “Amazing!!! Soooo proud of you and your team <3,” and my personal favorite, “This is mad cool!” In an effort to get more critical feedback, I also shared the piece in the Data Visualization Society’s Slack given that it is an online space of over 17,000 data visualization practitioners. The visualizations were well-received and the piece was chosen to be shared on the organization’s Facebook page as a showcase of community members’ work.</p>
</div>

<div class="step" data-step="24">
	<h5 id="ref4">Piece 4: Visualizing 200 Issues of the Gazelle</h5>
	<p>This piece sought to investigate the publication itself. After having 200 issues in circulation, other than mere presence, what has The Gazelle’s impact been in our community? For this piece, I worked with two other students again, hoping to impart a positive learning experience and a motivation to work on their own pieces. This exploration began with talking to community members about their thoughts about The Gazelle and what questions they would want to investigate. These conversations made us curious about the proportion of different writers in The Gazelle, the readership, and what changes have been made over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="25">
	<p>Because we were examining article headlines over time, the first visualization prompted thinking through the challenge of analyzing and visualizing text. Often, a keyword analysis is visualized using word clouds, which I wished to avoid. After using a packed circles diagram in a project last spring, I used this type of visualization to reveal the top words in article titles by semester (see fig 18). Unfortunately, the diagram was not meaningful given the redundancy of words like “NYUAD,” “The,” and other common words that did not provide insight into the most prevalent topics per semester. Thus, I chose to exclude common words like “NYUAD,” articles, and propositions.</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="26">
	<p>Inspired by tree rings growing each year, I wanted to show how the writers contributing to The Gazelle have accumulated each semester, creating a concentric dot visualization (see fig 19). I added frames to this visualization to also show the number of unique writers per semester and the proportion of individual writers’ contributions to the articles by semester using a pictograph bar chart for the former and a force-directed cluster layout for the latter.</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="27">
<p>In examining readership, I wanted to understand the age of readers (as a proxy for understanding how many students versus faculty/staff) and their locations. I contemplated using a stacked column chart, an effective visualization for showing the proportion of various groups over time, but thought it would be difficult to compare miniscule changes over semesters. Another factor I considered was using a visualization I’d never used before in a piece to expose our community to new ways of presenting data. Thus, I decided to use a radar chart including the ability to layer the charts to make the shift towards a younger demographic more clear (see fig 20). The reader could also choose which semesters to include in the visualization to show the change between specific semesters more visible.</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="28">
<p>After talking to The Gazelle’s Management, I realized that page views were a reflection of the publication’s impact. I initially wanted to visualize the historical page views of the top articles of all time, but found it unmeaningful (see fig 21).</p>
</div>

<p>Needing a new idea, I wanted to produce a visualization showing views of issues and individual articles while including a paragraph contextualizing the limitations of views as a metric. Given the multi-layering needed to show quantities at both the issue and article level, I needed a hierarchical visualization. A tree map would not be relevant given the importance of examining a singular element while a sunburst diagram could make it difficult to compare quantities at outer levels. Since I wanted a radial visualization given the large number of elements to represent, I decided to use a radial bar visualization. User testing revealed the need for explanatory text indicating the possible levels for the visualization which I subsequently included.</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="30">
	<p>This piece received a low amount of views compared to my previous pieces, yet this was the piece I was most proud of until that point. Some student community feedback included “So much talent and thought and creativity. In awe,” “This is beyond amazing. As a former TG writer, this data breakdown is so impressive. Absolutely in love with the gazelle team this year — y’all have been producing so many smart and critical pieces,” and “Such an incredibly informative data viz piece! Like truly super engaging and I literally spent like 30 mins on it. I’m so proud of the you and the desk! Really setting high standards and paving the way for the future.” </p>
	<p>Though the piece failed to gain traction amongst the entire NYUAD community, it meant a lot to the subset of people that follow The Gazelle. The publication’s weekly email encouraged its staff to read the piece: “Everyone should read it, spend time with the visualizations, because they truly capture the past, present and future of this publication, something that we all have a stake in.” The feedback received from the community indicating the process of “spending time” with the visualizations confirms the effective use of nonlinear storytelling; designing visualizations that offered enough complexity and several routes of exploration allowed the reader to engage at a deeper level and elicit meaning.</p>

	<h5 id="ref5">Piece 5: What It’s Like Being a Woman in STEM</h5>
	<p>Being part of a historically excluded community in STEM is hard. For my last piece, I wanted to highlight the need for greater institutional support for diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in STEM.</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="32">
<p>The first visualization examines gender representation in faculty from the science and engineering academic divisions. I struggled with creating this visualization given how juxtaposed the data was between the two categories. One priority for me in creating this visualization was to depart from the typical binary choice in color representation for gender--typically, red/pink is used for a female-identifying population and blue is used for a blue-identifying population. The original column chart did not work given all the missing values.</p>
<p>Thus, I built a population pyramid to make it easier to interpret despite missing values with a slide to just focus on the main titles: Assistant, Associate, and Professor.</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="33">
<p>I originally intended to produce a line chart showing a similar pattern in academic performance and self-confidence, but felt a mismatch between the genericness of the visual and the personal nature of the data. </p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="34">
	<p>Inspired by Lupi’s projects, I built a more abstract visualization to convey the themes about the importance of providing a safe learning environment for historically excluded individuals. I intended to create a packed circles visualization to represent the most frequently occurring text in a survey answering what the gender-marginalized STEM community wanted cis males in STEM to know, but felt like the data would be more meaningful as a virtual message board (see fig 28). Another interactive element of the piece included a panel of photos and descriptions of people in STEM at NYUAD. This added human context to the data and celebrated the gender-marginalized people in our community.</p>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="35">
	<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>Through my capstone research, I drew upon Data Humanism and Data Feminism to build a body of work examining power and using visualization in order to create a community data activism project. An unanticipated outcome of my project included building out a team of people based at The Gazelle to engage in investigative data reporting and develop interactive data experiences.</p>

<p>Was publishing these data investigations an effective form of activism? It is difficult to measure impact in a large institution given the slow pace of change. Additionally, as an average student, I have very little knowledge into the inner workings of the institution. The first piece about the campus convenience stores launched a more in-depth price analysis and raised student awareness of their consumer power, but given student dependence on campus vendors, simple awareness could not necessarily change students’ financial decisions. The second piece was sent out in faculty/staff newsletters and raised awareness in academic program development. The faculty education piece helped DEI bodies on campus advocate for change and launched a more data-driven approach in their work. The piece examining The Gazelle as a publication helped the publication’s management reflect on its role in the community and recognize that the publication has largely stayed the same since its inception. I’m curious to see what the new management team at The Gazelle implements. </p>
<p>Interestingly, at least two departments I know of have been inspired by these projects to hire students with sharp data analytics and visualization skills in order to measure their effectiveness and improve their work. The majority of these pieces went “viral” by the publication’s standards and got incredibly positive feedback, though it remains unclear whether these favorable reactions were due to the novelty of having interactive elements to “play” with in The Gazelle. I suppose the unsatisfying politically correct answer to this question is that it’s too soon to tell, but data activism projects at NYUAD have much potential now that the foundation has been laid.</p>
</div>

<div class="step" data-step="36">
	<p>These pieces helped me develop a methodology for future community data activist work.</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Continue educating yourself. Reflect on your positionality. Question instances of inequity and injustice.</li>
	<li>Identify what/who you wish to investigate.</li>
	<li>Talk to community members about the issue to gain context around the data. What questions do they have? What would they find interesting to explore?</li>
	<li>Find the source(s) of data to build your dataset.</li>
	<li>Be curious. Explore the data without accepting it as truth. Be mindful of potential errors in the dataset and reflect on what biases may be inherent in it.</li>
	<li>Outline the questions you wish to study. Play around with the data and survey for answers to your questions, being open-minded of new routes of exploration. </li>
	<li>Sketch ways to answer these questions with data. What is the best way for the reader to experience the data given the community context?</li>
	<li>Build your data experiences whether it be a visualization, a static graphic, a game, a sonified experience, etc.
	What is the best way for the reader to navigate this experience? What additional explanation might they need?</li>
	<li>User test the experience. Was there anything the tester didn’t understand? What story were they drawing from the experience?</li>
	<li>Re-iterate.</li>
	<li>Reflect on what sensitivities lie in your work.</li>
	<li>Talk to community members to gain additional context surrounding the experience.</li>
	<li>Test for accessibility. What do the colors look like for people of various visual abilities? How would your data be experienced by someone using a screen reader?</li>
	<li>Share your work and thank the people that helped you along the way.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="37">
	<p>A challenge I faced was being unable to integrate my interactive graphics directly into the article; I had to insert the graphics as iframe tags from an outside program, potentially creating a less smooth user experience. In future projects for The Gazelle, I would recommend working with the publication’s web team to develop a custom React component to integrate the visualizations/other interactive graphics. An additional improvement would be creating a data visualization style guide to ensure accessibility of color palette and navigation. Accessibility is still an underesearched topic in data visualization, but based on research I could find, I avoided flashing images, tested color palettes for various visual abilities, and provided alternative text for screen readers (Makenec). In the future, community data pieces should also make sure visualizations are navigable by keyboard and keep up to date with latest best practices in data visualization accessibility research.
</p>

	<p>In order to create a culture of community data activism, there also needs to be a level of institutional support. Having a space where any community member can access institutional data would help build transparency and improve dynamics within the community. Some datasets that should be shared with the community through an open data repository include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The representation of high schools that students come from within countries (at a surface level, the NYUAD student body appears diverse in terms of number of countries represented. However, often, students come from the same few elite institutions in a particular country.)</li>
		<li>Where NYUAD students go to grad school (What is NYUAD’s effect on mobility? Do students holding specific passports have similar locations in where they attend a graduate program?)</li>
		<li>The research that NYUAD faculty publish </li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="38">
	<p>In the future, I hope to apply the lessons learned from this experience in future data storytelling investigative pieces. This project broadened the possibilities of working with data creatively while challenging the status quo. This summer, I will be a Data Science Fellow at the US Census Bureau in my home country building data pipelines and visualizations to explore economic patterns in the US and how they impact historically excluded communities. I also hope to continue working on my personal project visualizing the issues surrounding local journalism in my home state; this project was originally intended to be my capstone and I hope to revisit it given the insight I’ve gained from the pieces I’ve produced this year.</p>

	<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
	<p>This project could not have been completed without Jonny Farrow and Heather Dewey-Hagborg for their patience, life lessons, and thoughtful feedback throughout the past year. I hold deep respect and appreciation for the Interactive Media department at NYUAD for shaping me into a more critical thinker and reflective technologist. I am also grateful for the women who have supported me throughout my NYUAD journey and, without whom, I would not be graduating this semester.
