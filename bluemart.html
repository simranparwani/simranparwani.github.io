	<p>A trip to the NYUAD Convenience Store is like paying for a taxi in certain countries--you know you’ve been overcharged, but you hand over the cash anyway with little more than a shrug. I too am guilty of tossing my convenience store receipt without so much as a glance, but I began becoming more mindful of my dining dirhams’ purchasing power last fall when Sushi Counter removed its 35% student discount if one paid with dining dirhams. Sushi Counter’s new policy launched a discussion in online student spaces and later, a Gazelle article, about the value of campus dirhams and whether they were “real money.” As a partial aid student, I certainly felt the difference in value when my 24 dirham sushi burrito became 37 campus dirhams. Because I do not receive a stipend, I rely on dining dirhams to cover my living expenses including toiletries and household goods. When these items cost more, I am able to buy less with my dining dirhams and need to rely on my personal savings to cover the difference. The total cost of my NYUAD education increases without any added value. </p>

	<p>This past summer, the NYUAD administration announced changes to the stipend disbursement, such that 25% of my peers’ stipends became allocated as Falcon Dirhams, a new type of campus dirham. In creating this plan, the admin assumed a 1:1 equivalency ratio between Falcon Dirhams and the UAE dirhams received in previous stipends. However, given that Falcon Dirhams can only be used at certain vendors on campus, I hoped to explore whether campus dirhams really had a 1:1 equivalency ratio using the NYUAD Convenience Store operated by Blue Mart as a case study.</p>

	<p>I collected data on 89 products, recording the prices of the NYUAD Blue Mart Convenience Store, Lulu Hypermarket, Carrefour UAE, and other Blue Mart locations. Let’s first explore NYUAD Blue Mart prices in comparison with leading grocery brands Lulu and Carrefour. Given the difficulty of understanding a visualization with 89 products, I manually annotated the products with a category name to filter what was being displayed.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
	<p>In this Cleveland Dot Chart, one can broadly see that NYUAD Blue Mart prices are generally more expensive but it is difficult to make overall conclusions across categories given differences in x-axis scaling. Furthermore, it is difficult to really understand just how much more expensive are NYUAD Blue Mart prices. Are there certain products where NYUAD Blue Mart prices are much higher than others? Are there products where NYUAD Blue Mart prices are cheaper?</p>

	<p>To explore these questions, I calculated the percent difference (difference between NYUAD and Lulu prices divided by the average of the NYUAD and Lulu prices) for each product where NYUAD Blue Mart prices were greater than those of Lulu. It would be difficult to say that on average, NYUAD Blue Mart prices are a specific percentage more than Lulu prices given the differences in the individual products. Thus, I hoped to look at the distribution of these percent differences...how many of the products in my sample had a percent difference of 10% versus 30%? Since the Nature Valley Crunchy Oats&Coconut bar was not available at Lulu as a single bar and there are seven products where NYUAD Blue Mart was actually cheaper, this sample is out of 81 products. In this histogram, you can see the distribution of the products’ percent differences between NYUAD Blue Mart and Lulu.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
	<p>Through this histogram, you can see that many of the products in the sample fall into the 20% to 40% difference range. A summary of the seven products where NYUAD Blue Mart prices are cheaper are listed below. Thus, if you are purchasing a Sensodyne product or the Fine toilet paper, you can rest assured your purchase will be made at a competitive price.</p>

	<p>I was also curious to explore whether Blue Mart was simply a more expensive grocery brand given differences in size or whether there were price differences between NYUAD Blue Mart and other Blue Mart locations. Using the Blue Mart DXB e-commerce app, I was able to find the overall Blue Mart prices for 35 of the products in my sample. I visualized these 35 products’ prices using a connected dot plot to understand, at a big picture level, whether there were any differences in the prices between the Blue Mart on campus and other Blue Mart locations.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
	<p>Though it is difficult to understand the difference in prices relative to the price of each product, this visualization shows there are clear disparities in pricing between the Blue Mart on campus and other Blue Mart locations. I reached out to the NYUAD Blue Mart team to understand the factors that go into their pricing but they directed me to the ADNH-Compass team instead. ADNH-Compass subsequently informed me that they were “not authorized to speak to any publications.”</p>

	<p>Let's examine on these costs affect us on a personal level.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
	<p>In this example, ten products were randomly selected from the original sample of 89 products. Depending on the number of items you purchased, you likely experienced a loss of 70 to 120 dirhams a semester. Imagine how that loss increases when you consider all the products available from the NYUAD Convenience Store and all the students that use it for their primary source of groceries.</p>

<p>As a student body, we need to become more aware of our purchasing power with Dining and Falcon dirhams especially because this issue now affects all of us on campus. Whether we are on partial aid or now receive a portion of our stipend in Falcon Dirhams, we can no longer make the excuse that campus dirhams are not "real money." As Omar Ould Ali (class of 2022), former Dining Committee Chair, stated in the aftermath of the Sushi Counter policy change, “In the long run, if we remain complacent, the value of campus dirhams will decrease as the "campus dirhams products" prices will be much higher than the actual market price. Please remember that your consumer behavior right now is going to affect the purchasing ability of those who come after you.”</p>
