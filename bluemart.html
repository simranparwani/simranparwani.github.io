	<p>A trip to the NYU Abu Dhabi Convenience Store is like paying for a taxi in certain countries — you know you’ve been overcharged, but you hand over the cash anyway with little more than a shrug. I too am guilty of tossing my convenience store receipt without so much as a glance, but became more mindful of purchasing power when Sushi Counter altered it’s student discount last fall. Sushi Counter’s new policy <a href="https://www.thegazelle.org/issue/173/features/real-or-fake-students-perspective-on-campus-dirhams" >launched a discussion</a> about the value of campus dirhams and whether they were “real money.” As a partial aid student, I certainly felt the difference in value when my 24 dirham sushi burrito became 37 campus dirhams. Because I do not receive a stipend, I rely on dining dirhams to cover my living expenses including toiletries and household goods. When these items cost more, I am able to buy less with my dining dirhams and need to rely on my personal savings to cover the difference. The total cost of my NYUAD education increases without any added value. </p>

	<p>This past summer, the NYUAD administration <a href="https://www.thegazelle.org/issue/181/news/everything-we-know-about-changes-to-stipend-distribution">announced changes to the stipend disbursement</a>, such that 25 percent of my peers’ stipends became allocated as Falcon Dirhams, a new type of campus dirham. In creating this plan, the admin assumed a 1:1 equivalency ratio between Falcon Dirhams and the UAE dirhams received in previous stipends.  But do Falcon Dirhams, restricted to only certain vendors, really have equivalent purchasing power in the NYUAD Convenience Store?</p>

	<p>Using data on 89 products, I explore NYUAD Blue Mart prices in comparison with leading grocery brands Lulu and Carrefour.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
	<p>In this chart, one can broadly see that NYUAD Blue Mart prices are generally more expensive but it is difficult to make overall conclusions across categories. Are there certain products where NYUAD Blue Mart prices are much higher than others? Are there products where the prices are actually cheaper?</p>

	<p>To explore these questions, I calculated the percent difference for each product where NYUAD Blue Mart prices were greater than those of Lulu. It would be difficult to say that on average, NYUAD Blue Mart prices are a specific percentage more than Lulu prices given the differences in the individual products. Thus, I hoped to look at the distribution of these percent differences...how many of the products in my sample had a percent difference of 10% versus 30%? In this histogram, you can see the distribution of the products’ percent differences between NYUAD Blue Mart and Lulu.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
	<p>Many of the products in the sample fall into the 20% to 40% difference range, but two products in the 60 to 70% difference range that you should probably stay clear of include Masafi Tissues and the Nature Valley Salted Caramel Nut Protein bar, both almost double the respective price found at LuLu. </p>

	<p>A summary of the seven products where NYUAD Blue Mart prices are cheaper are listed below. Thus, if you are purchasing a Sensodyne product or the Fine toilet paper, you can rest assured your purchase will be made at a competitive price.</p>

	<p>Is Blue Mart just a more expensive grocery store than LuLu and Carrefour? Using their Dubai e-commerce app, I visualized these 35 products’ prices using a connected dot plot to understand, at a big picture level, whether there were any differences in the prices between the Blue Mart on campus and other Blue Mart locations.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
	<p>Though it is difficult to understand the difference in prices relative to the price of each product, this visualization shows there are clear disparities in pricing between the Blue Mart on campus and other Blue Mart locations. I reached out to the NYUAD Blue Mart team to understand the factors that go into their pricing but they directed me to the ADNH-Compass team instead. ADNH-Compass subsequently informed me that they were “not authorized to speak to any publications.”</p>

	<p>Let's examine how these costs affect us on a personal level.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
	<p>In this example, ten products were randomly selected from the original sample of 89 products. Depending on the number of items you purchased, you likely experienced a loss of 70 to 120 dirhams a semester. Imagine how that loss increases when you consider all the products available from the NYUAD Convenience Store and all the students that use it for their primary source of groceries.</p>

<p>As a student body, we need to become more aware of our purchasing power with Dining and Falcon dirhams especially because this now affects all of us on campus whether we are on partial aid or now receive a portion of our stipend in Falcon dirhams. </p>

<p>“In the long run, if we remain complacent, the value of campus dirhams will decrease as the campus dirhams products prices will be much higher than the actual market price”, stated Omar Ould Ali, Class of 2022 and former Dining Committee Chair, in the aftermath of the Sushi Counter policy change. “Please remember that your consumer behavior right now is going to affect the purchasing ability of those who come after you.”</p>
