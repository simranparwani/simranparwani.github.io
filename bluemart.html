	<p>A trip to the NYU Abu Dhabi Convenience Store is like paying for a taxi in certain countries — you know you have been overcharged, but you hand over the cash anyway with little more than a shrug. I too am guilty of tossing my convenience store receipt without so much as a glance, but became more mindful of purchasing power when Sushi Counter altered it’s student discount last fall. Sushi Counter’s new policy <a href="https://www.thegazelle.org/issue/173/features/real-or-fake-students-perspective-on-campus-dirhams" >launched a discussion</a> about the value of campus dirhams and whether they were “real money.” As a partial aid student, I certainly felt the difference in value when my 24 dirham sushi burrito became 37 campus dirhams. Because I do not receive a stipend, I rely on dining dirhams to cover my living expenses including toiletries and household goods. When these items cost more, I am able to buy less with my dining dirhams and need to rely on my personal savings to cover the difference. The total cost of my NYUAD education increases without any added value. </p>

	<p>This past summer, the NYUAD administration <a href="https://www.thegazelle.org/issue/181/news/everything-we-know-about-changes-to-stipend-distribution">announced changes to the stipend disbursement</a>, such that 25 percent of my peers’ stipends became allocated as Falcon Dirhams, a new type of campus dirham. In creating this plan, the admin assumed a 1:1 equivalency ratio between Falcon Dirhams and the UAE dirhams received in previous stipends.  But do Falcon Dirhams, restricted to only certain vendors, really have equivalent purchasing power in the NYUAD Convenience Store?</p>

	<p>Using data on 89 products, I explore NYUAD Blue Mart prices in comparison with leading grocery brands Lulu and Carrefour.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
	<p>In this chart, one can broadly see that NYUAD Blue Mart prices are generally more expensive. Given NYUAD students’ reliance on campus vendors, there is less incentive for NYUAD Blue Mart to offer competitive prices, a dependency that has only grown with the introduction of Falcon Dirhams. Suzan Sadek, Class of 2022, used to buy groceries off-campus because of the greater variety and cheaper prices. “Since 25 percent of my stipend is now going to Falcon Dirhams, I feel like I have to use the money so, recently, I do all my grocery shopping in the convenience store despite them not having certain things I need,” she explained. As the Sushi Counter policy change revealed, as students and consumers, we are cornered when deciding where to spend.</p>
	<h2>How much more expensive or cheaper are NYUAD Blue Mart products?</h2>

	<p>Since it is difficult to make overall conclusions across categories using the dot chart, let’s zoom in a bit. Are there certain products where NYUAD Blue Mart prices are much higher than others? Are there products where the prices are actually cheaper?</p>
	<p>To explore these questions, I calculated the percent difference for each product with data available for both NYUAD and LuLu. It would be difficult to say that on average, NYUAD Blue Mart prices are a specific percentage more than LuLu prices given the differences in the individual products. In this stacked histogram, you can see the distribution of the products’ percent differences between NYUAD Blue Mart and LuLu.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
	<p>Many of the products in the sample fall into the 20% to 40% difference range, but two products in the 60 to 70% difference range that you should probably stay clear of include Masafi Tissues and the Nature Valley Salted Caramel Nut Protein bar, both almost double the respective price found at LuLu. </p>

	<h2>How do NYUAD Blue Mart prices compare to other Blue Mart locations?</h2>
	<p>Is Blue Mart just a more expensive grocery store than LuLu and Carrefour? Using their Dubai e-commerce app, I visualized 35 products’ prices using a connected dot plot to understand, at a big picture level, whether there were any differences in the prices between the Blue Mart on campus and other Blue Mart locations.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
	<p>Though it is difficult to understand the difference in prices relative to the price of each product, this visualization shows there are clear disparities in pricing between the Blue Mart on campus and other Blue Mart locations. I reached out to the NYUAD Blue Mart team to understand the factors that go into their pricing but they directed me to the ADNH-Compass team instead. ADNH-Compass subsequently informed me that they were “not authorized to speak to any publications.”</p>

	<p>Blue Mart then referred me to Adam Kice, Manager of Campus Services, Dining and Housing for NYUAD.  Kice explained that Blue Mart had been selected as a campus vendor before he worked at NYUAD. “[The selection team] looked at the ability to provide the needed service for the size and location of the store on campus, while ensuring that the vendor could offer a broad range of products to meet the needs of our community.” He added that he was unaware of the different pricing structure between NYUAD Blue Mart and other Blue Mart locations, but that he was working with the Student Government Dining Committee to begin a transparent price analysis with Blue Mart.</p>
	<h2>How do NYUAD Blue Mart prices affect us?</h2>

<div class="paragraph">
	<p>In this example, ten products were randomly selected from the original sample of 89 products. If you purchased these ten products every week, you would lose 417 dirhams over a semester. Imagine how that loss scales when you consider all the products available from the NYUAD Convenience Store and the number of students making these purchases.</p>

<p>As a student body, we need to become more aware of our purchasing power with Dining and Falcon dirhams especially because this now affects all of us on campus whether we are on partial aid or now receive a portion of our stipend in Falcon dirhams. </p>

<p>“In the long run, if we remain complacent, the value of campus dirhams will decrease as the campus dirhams products prices will be much higher than the actual market price”, stated Omar Ould Ali, Class of 2022 and former Dining Committee Chair, in the aftermath of the Sushi Counter policy change. “Please remember that your consumer behavior right now is going to affect the purchasing ability of those who come after you.”</p>
