			<p>For a group project for the UX Course at Steinhardt, we aimed to redesign the meditation app: Stop, Breathe, and Think. I was responsible for designing the dashboard page where the user could track their progress in their meditation journey. Our initial user testing revealed that only 50% of our user testers could see their activity for a given day and that users found the original design having an overwhelming amount of different colors. Thus, the overall objectives of redesigning the dashboard page was to create a less stressful UI and display metrics that clearly showed the improvements that meditation can bring as to establish the habit of frequent meditation practice.

			<p>The lo-fi prototype focused on creating a consistent user interface visually and displaying relevant data metrics to the user. The interface was made cleaner, more approachable and retained only relevant elements. In the user research, only 50% of users were able to find the activity that was completed on a specific day. Thus, we hoped to make finding daily progress very clear. One of the key metrics was adding the physical and emotional settledness before and after meditation to demonstrate to the user the benefits of meditation to them personally. Additionally, we added the ability to see activity completed at a daily view. We also streamlined the streaks metric and displayed the userâ€™s favorite meditations.

			<p>In the first hi-fi prototype of the dashboard, we added a title to create more cohesion for the elements on the page. We also added colors consistent with the other redesigned pages to create a consistent visual identity. The lavender was chosen as our primary color for its soothing tones. We also changed where elements appeared on the page to avoid confusing all-time summary metrics with the weekly view and changed a couple of phrases in terms of language to be more clear about what was being displayed.

		<div style="padding-top:5%" class="row">
			<p>In user testing the initial hi-fi prototype, we found that using the same graphics from the check-in process for the weekly view was hard to understand. Additionally, we wanted to make it more clear the before and after meditation well-being, so we removed having two different views and placed them on the same graph using a quantity of well-being compounded from the emotional and physical check-in. Another point of feedback was that having all the metrics on one page was too overwhelming for the user and it was hard to distinguish the all-time metrics from the daily. Therefore, we had two different views: one for weekly progress and one for summary. On the summary tab, we also added a message to the user with the option to share their journey. The user message was added to increase the sense of personalization that was so appreciated in the usability testing. The share your journey button was due to the fact that we were designing this app for millennial/gen Z users like our personas and that sharing progress incentivizes these users to maintain their progress and shows friends/family what they are up to. This assumption is justified by the huge amount of social sharing that is done with self-quantification visualizations like Fitbit and Spotify Unwrapped. Additionally, the language weekly settledness was changed to weekly well-being and displaying the meditations completed and the time meditated was combined into one metric for simplification.
