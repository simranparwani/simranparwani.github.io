	<div class="row">
		
			<p>For an eight hour individual game challenge where I had to create a digital game that only used rectangles, my first step was asking clarifying questions...technically, we could place any image in a rectangular sprite, so were we allowed to use images? The answer was we could not.

		<p>I began thinking about what I wanted to convey to the user through the game. The theme that kept coming up in my ideation process was the concept of a rat race, perhaps because I was starting to have that epiphany that I didn’t want to work at a FAANG company, the very metric of success for CS students at my school. I next considered how I could visually create a rat race and ended up with a maze that the player scrolls through vertically as if climbing their way to the top. I wanted to create some sort of fake objective throughout the game so I had the user collect green rectangles that increased the player’s score with text displaying the number of points needed to advance to the next level, but there was no actual effect. There was also the option of collecting flowers, but these were more sparse and would only appear behind the user so that they would have to go out of their way to collect the flowers. The more flowers the user collected, the more colorful their environment would become and the less walls would appear in the maze until finally there were no walls at all and the player could move in any direction they choose.

			<p>Next, I coded the game in JavaScript and then began user testing. My favorite user quote was “all the rectangles makes it look like shitty donkey kong but it made me feel very existential.” 
I enjoyed this project because it helped me realize how much I could already do with the limited CS knowledge I had. I also enjoyed getting to work on each aspect of creating a product in limited time: designing it, implementing it, and conducting user playtesting.
