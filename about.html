  <p>Simran Parwani is a data storyteller. Her fascination with finding narratives in data and visualizing them is an intersection of her interests in code, visualization design, and social impact. She is currently a fourth-year student at New York University Abu Dhabi where she studies Interactive Media and Computer Science with a minor in Design.  Her academic research centers on using data visualization and emerging technologies to improve the way that we share information and stories. She has produced visualizations for Free the Tampons, NBCUniversal, Grant Thornton, and other organizations. In summer 2020, she was a team leader and a founding member of the Vital Voices Innovation Lab where she prototyped ways for female entrepreneurs to use technology and visualization to share their impact. <br><br>

She is currently working on bringing data storytelling to her school newspaper through her data column and starting a Datathon for Social Impact at her school. In addition to her work on data visualizations and the ethical considerations of data, she cares about building inclusive communities. She currently serves as the co-President of the Womxn in STEM club on her campus where she is focusing on retaining more first years in STEM majors and recognizing the intersectionalities within the community.

<p>1.<br>
I love throwing parties. I enjoy designing experiences and environments that facilitate bringing people together. As I’ve pursued my academic studies in computer science and interactive media, my fascination with human interaction has expanded to include the way people learn about each other through a screen.
<br>
2.<br>
I want to build a world of mutual respect and empathy through my work. I believe using data visualizations and emerging technologies strengthens the way people understand the other people represented in the stories and information shared. When reading about the path a refugee took, it is easy to keep reading without trying to understand that person’s experience. When seeing that same path visually or experiencing it partially through extended reality, that understanding shifts into empathy.
<br>
3.<br>
I build visualizations that are accurate, easy to understand, and beautiful -- in that order. I aim to create visualizations that are playful, where a person is able to interact with data tangibly and flip their understanding of what data is and what data is meaningful. When a person is able to interact with various elements in the data, they are able to reframe their understanding of it -- it becomes less of a black box that they take for granted.
<br>
4.<br>
Data has often been used as a surveillance method on non-white and non-male-presenting bodies. Through my work, I subvert who decides what and whose data is collected. I reclaim control of data and use it as a tool to highlight injustice and advocate for change. In short, I hope to become a data activist.
<br>
5.<br>
I believe in connecting the dots, that creativity is a practice of forming new ideas and new associations between ideas. As a personal principle, I like asking questions and leaving things better than how I find them, whether in my school, workplace, or community.
<br>
6.<br>
My work has been in static and interactive digital visualizations up to date. I hope to branch into researching what more empathetic, more tactile, and more expressive visualizations might look like. Some of these more physical forms of visualization could include AR/VR, physical computing, and movement of one’s body.
