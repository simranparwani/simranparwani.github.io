<p>1.<br>
I love throwing parties (though not so much in the past two years)...I enjoy designing experiences and environments that facilitate bringing people together. As Iâ€™ve pursued my academic studies in computer science and interactive media, my fascination with human interaction has expanded to include the way people learn about each other through a screen and connect to their own humanity.
<br>
2.<br>
I want to build a world of mutual respect and empathy through my work. I believe using data visualizations and emerging technologies in storytelling strengthens the way people understand the other people and places represented in the stories and information shared. 
<br>
3.<br>
Overall, I aim to create visualizations that are playful and accessible, where a person is able to interact with data tangibly and flip their understanding of what data is and what data is meaningful. When a person is able to interact with various elements in the data, they are able to reframe their understanding of it -- it becomes less of a black box that they take for granted.
<br>
4.<br>
Data has often been used as a surveillance method on non-white and non-male-presenting bodies. Through my work, I hope to subvert who decides what and whose data is collected. I would like to reclaim control of data and use it as a tool to highlight injustice and advocate for change. 
<br>
5.<br>
I believe in connecting the dots, that creativity is a practice of forming new ideas and new associations between ideas. As a personal principle, I like asking questions and leaving things better than how I find them, whether in my school, workplace, or community.
<br>
6.<br>
On my journey of becoming, I'm trying hard not to define myself by what I do, a difficult practice in this capitalistic world. The titles I formally hold right now are "Data Visualization Intern" at FiveThirtyEight and "Early Career Director" on the board of the Data Visualization Society. However, I hope to define myself as a human who is curious, empathetic, loving, playful, creative, and inclusive. In my free time, I currently listen to Brene Brown podcasts, paint, drink chai, and practice yoga.

PS this website is a playground that grows with me. My next iteration of this website will integrate a CMS to manage the pages less messily/include a blog reflecting on my practice of dataviz, be built with svelte.js instead of vanilla javascript, have an about page with custom D3 visualizations, and have better writeups of projects.
