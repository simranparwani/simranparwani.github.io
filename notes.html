                <h1>Week 7: Progress</h1>
                <p>This week, I've been working on the presentation, learning the front end framework Vue.js, and working on the second visualization showing consolidation of newspapers. I'm feeling a bit frustrated this week as I feel like I don't have enough to show for the community milestone given all the work I've put in. Vue.js has been a bit difficult for me to learn from scratch and while I've made progress on the second visualization, I don't think it will be in a demo state.</p><br>

                <p>This week, I built out a scrollytelling version of my chloropleth map showing the number of papers. I'm still struggling a bit with the color scale...I'm not sure how intuitive it is so I shall have to explore this in user testing more. </p>
                <p>I tested my color palette for various visual abilities and did research on accessibility in data visualization. This was difficult as accessibility in visualization is still underexamined but it's clear that usual web standards of accessibility are not enough. My main goals in terms of accessibility will be to make my visualizations keyboard accessible and to use color palettes that are still understandable for various visual abilities. Here is a demo of my scrollytelling piece.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPjnW-NqNys" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>

                <h1>Week 5: Progress</h1>
                <p>This week, I've restructured my project a bit. I found a lot of discrepancies in my dataset which just goes to show don't trust data blindly. Though my project intended to focus on the visualization aspect, I started falling in love with the stories behind each publication, looking at each individual data point. It's interesting how I really used the methods of data humanism, one of my theoretical frameworks, after all given its emphasis on the individuality of data. This week, I've mostly just worked on the dataset, scouring obituaries, county records, and more. This has helped me realize how these publications are really at the core of my work so I want to make a community database of local newspapers in Ohio to accompnay my visualization. Given all the work I've done in building my own dataset, it would be nice to create some centralized point for others to work with the data because there isn't really any reliable source of data I could find for myself. </p> <br>

                <p>This week, I am trying to build my second iteration of a visualization showing the consolidation of ownership of newspapers. My previous iteration made it unclear what exactly was happening though it was fun to play with. This iteration was I've been considering what is the balance between user freedom to interact with visualizations and creating a narrative that walks them through the visualization. </p>
                <p>Thus, I wanted to recreate the last iteration by actually showing the consolidation of the groups through movement of the circles (newspapers). I was inspired by <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/">this piece. </a> I'll update this post with a video of what I built in a couple of days as there's a bug right now. Another update: got my funding and confirmed my capstone panel: Jonny (my mentor), Joerg, and Azza Abouzied, a CS professor.</p> <br>

                <p>After a lot of reflection on my project, I decided to pivot a bit because I realize the project in its previous format just filled me with so much anxiety and wasn't serving me. There's a personal project I've been working on based on one of my prototypes last semester and given that I have so much more motivation to work on that and have been working on it more than my capstone, I decided to make that personal project my capstone. I talked to my advisor about it and he was very supportive. One positive of working on this personal project as my capstone is that it will hopefully be an interactive visualization piece that I am proud of and can use in apply for jobs in data viz. Addiitonally, given the situation around COVID, I will be able to build a piece that is entirely digital. The research and frameworks I situated my project in will not change. In regard to budget, I hadn't submitted yet because I felt so anxious about my project, so I just submitted my budget proposal after discussion with my advisor. I'm feeling so much more at peace and excited about capstone.</p><br>

                <p>Instead of photos, here is <a href="https://ohionewsdeserts-nyudataviz.glitch.me/">the proof of concept </a> I built.</p><br>
                <p>I'm planning to do visualizations for number of newspaper/county over time, the consolidation of ownership over time, changes in circulation and publishing frequency over time, and have views for individual newspaper, county, and owner group. In regard to timeline, in short, I hope to have all the coding part done February 25.</p>

                <p>Building off my idea of creating an archive of the experience of this year, I started drafting questions for the user. I am still not sure about the look and feel. I don't really like the idea of having an input box (as displayed in these photos) as it feels like a constraint. It is, after all, a literal boundary on user input. And this year certainly does not fit between lines. I'll keep iterating on the questions and design of the interface.</p>

                <p>Thought of a couple of ideas! At first, I wanted to do data portraits of people in Abu Dhabi because there are so many different stories and backgrounds and I wanted to go beyond the usual metrics collected on people here like nationality and income level and occupation. I wanted to know how long have people been here, how many people in their family are not here with them, whey they like to do for fun, etc. Another variation of this idea would be doing a physical installation with an accompanying web piece about processing this year and serving as an archive for future generations to know more about what we've experienced in this time. I want to go beyond the statistics of number of cases, distribution by country, dollars lost in the economy and use data to understand the human experience of the pandemic.

                I imagine having a physical installation with a tablet.

                <h1>Week 7: Capstone Reflection</h1>
                <p>
I’ve usually been able to separate my academic life and my personal life. However, Capstone seems to take all these aspects of life and smush them together like a glob of play-doh, devastating any semblance I had of order and control. I think that’s why it has been so difficult for me to reflect on how Capstone is going because it feels so intertwined with everything else in my life and so all I can muster to say is that I’m hanging in there.</p>
<p>Rereading this first paragraph makes me want to laugh in a way. Why has Capstone been elevated to such an angsty dramatic level when it is, in reality, just like any other IM project at its core? Why do I synonymize Capstone and creativity and place creativity at a dangerously elusive pedestal when it is a daily practice? Why do I spend so much time thinking about Capstone as a concept instead of actually working on it?</p>
<p>I felt much better about the process after last week--after doing my extended critique with the class and having another meeting with my capstone mentor, Jonny. After writing the midterm paper about my inspirations, I found it easier to pinpoint what exactly I wanted to gather from the projects that inspire me. From Giorgia Lupi’s Data Humanism work, I wanted to explore how one could evoke empathy through a data visualization. From Gwendolyn Warren’s counter data project with Black youth in Detroit and her powerful visualization of commuters running over Black children in downtown Detroit, I hope to explore data activism--where this empathy through visualization can inspire action. From Catherine D’Ignazio’s art and research, I hope to explore how marginalized communities can reclaim control of data and subvert what institutions decide is important. From Shirley Wu’s ITP installation and accompanying web piece, I hope to explore what a visualization could look like in both physical computing and web. 
Taking these goals together, I feel like I have a strong idea of the underlying values for my project and the effect I want it to have. </p>

<p>I presented this to the class last week during my extended critique and was happy to hear that my ideas were communicated clearly. One important piece of feedback I received was to make it clear what the exact action I want my piece to inspire in terms of the “data activism” part of my project. I also just appreciated the wholesomeness of the class talking me through my anxieties.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of what I’ve worked on so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prototyped a playful data visualization exploring consolidation of local newspapers in Ohio</li>
<li>Re-iterated that prototype with leading the user through the story of it using scrollytelling techniques</li>
<li>Did a counterdata project to collect data about NYUAD Convenience Store prices. Instead of doing a visualization, I coded a game to help students actually experience how the data affects them → turned it into a Gazelle article</li>
<li>Read Data Feminism by Lauren Klein and Catherine D’Ignazio and Dear Data by Giorgia Lupi</li>
<li>Building an LED lightshow to visualize the influence of female Nobel Prize winners</li>
</ul>
<p>I felt “stuck” when I met with Jonny last week. I had the structure and values of what I wanted to do, but I didn’t have the substance that created that structure. Talking to him gave me some good ideas about moving forward. He also described a couple of projects he has worked on and talked me through his process of “narrowing focus,” which I think is the hardest part of the creative process. He also suggested reading a couple of books that were slightly unrelated to my topic to help inspire me out of this rut, such as a French philosophy book and a book called Glitch Feminism given my interest in the Glitch Studies Manifesto I had read as a sophomore in his Circuit Breakers! class.</p>
<p>Through building the visualization of Ohio newspaper ownership, I’ve learned that I want to build visualizations where the user can “play” with the data. I also learned what are some ways you can make visualizations less dependent on the external legend and make it more intuitive. </p>
<p>Through doing the mini project on the NYUAD convenience store prices, I’ve learned about building my own community datasets and designing interactions that allow the user to experience the data in their own context.</p>
<p>Through reading Dear Data, my understanding of data and the traditional methods associated with it has been completely transformed. I now question: What data do we find meaningful? Why must we aggregate data into visualizations that can be interpreted quickly? How can we use data as a way to understand ourselves and the people around us?</p>
<p>Through reading Data Feminism, I’ve learned so much about the logic behind the gendered binary of emotion and reason and the existing thoughts in the data viz community about the importance of visual minimalism and objectivity in visualization. I also learned about how important it is to consider intersectionality in data.</p>
<p>Through building the LED lightshow, I have learned how demotivating it is to do physical computing right now and the difficulty of experimenting. </p>

                <h1>Update: October 11</h1>
                <p>I ended up expanding upon my capstone work last week into an article that I published for the school newspaper.</p>

                <p>10.6.20.——sitting in my room listening to random beeps on my phone in the corner from Slack (the only notifications I allow right now but strongly reconsidering this)</p>
                <p>I was really interested in the idea of counterdata, when people take it upon themselves to collect the data missing at the institutional level. I wanted to explore this topic in the context of NYUAD where there are so many missing datasets...faculty diversity, student enrollment in various STEM courses to measure the diversity, etc. I decided to focus on something that I could tackle in a week so I decided to start collecting data from the NYUAD convenience store and other grocery stores in the region. I thought about ways I could visualize this information but I thought the way to produce the greatest empathy would be through having students actually go shopping and see the loss in purchasing power. Since the user would be making the decisions of what to purchase, there would be an emotional investment in the experience.</p>

                <p>I cannot code on a screen any longer (Zoom fatigue is real), hence I designed a static visualization. For context, I visualized what I drank for five days, paying attention to the container I consumed them in to be more mindful of the waste I produce</p>

                <p>I was inspired by the Data Humanism work of Federica Fragapane and Giorgia Lupi. I tried to avoid dashboard looking visualizations and create a custom visualization that was more playful and expressive. I was also fascinated by Nicholas Felton's self-quantification work, but it feels a bit self-absorbed though I suppose it is helpful for individual reflection and initiating personal behavioral change</p>

                <p>09.22.20.——sitting in my room post-quarantine listening to oh wonder</p>
                <p>This week, I feel a lot better about the capstone process and less nervous, especially after we explored our initial prototypes last week.</p> 
                <p>This week, I read two more chapters of Data Feminism, hope to finish it this week. I watched the Social Dilemma...for research purposes of course since it covered many of the topics my intended research sources discuss. I did not particularly like the film and felt like it excluded many important voices in the field like Safiya Noble and Ruha Benjamin. Furthermore, most of the people they interviewed were white men who created these products and used the film as a way to find redemption and avoid blame.</p>
                <p>Mini rant over. For my prototype, I wanted to build more affordances into the visualization. I found an <a href="https://webflow.com/blog/scrollytelling-guide">interesting guide to "scrollytelling,"</a> a way to guide the user through the visualization knowing that people often skip the legends and start playing with the visualization (I may be speaking from experience).</p>
                <p>Some examples of scrollytelling experiences I love are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/index.html#/?part=tunnel-creek">Snow Fall</a> from the NY Times, the introduction in <a href="https://www.codex-atlanticus.it/">Codex Atlanticus</a>, and <a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/03/hamilton/">An Interactive Visualization of Every Line in Hamilton</a>.</p>
                <p>I began by considering how to walk the user through the visualization. It definitely brought up that balance of giving the user freedom to explore while guiding the user through specific points. Based on seeing my peers interact with the initial prototype, I decided to define what each element in the visualization is through annotation, show the user every year with an explanation of what was happening, and end the "scrollytelling" in a way that they could explore at their pace.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/ClBAb6HktUHUYFDgEwWySg/capstone?node-id=3%3A35&scaling=scale-down">Here is my storyboard.</a></p>
                <p>After testing the prototype myself a few times, I realize that I don't need to walk the user through each year and then go to the exploration part. Rather, I can just have a fixed explanation for each year and the user can explore using the scrollbar and see the explanation for each year.</p>

                <h1>Week One</h1>
                <p>09.15.20.——sitting in my room in quarantine listening to a playlist of intense throwbacks like Hips Don't Lie by Shakira</p>
                <p>This week, I felt quite nervous about beginning the capstone process. I left our first class feeling absolutely unqualified to be there and terrifed about creating this first prototype.</p> 
                <p>Since the hardest part of something daunting is often starting, I began with reading Data Feminism, a book written by two researchers I respect: Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein. I'm about halfway through, but already find it so helpful in connecting the dots of what I've explored in both my IM and CS classes. Some interesting works that came up:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Los feminicidios en México, a counterdata project by María Salguero to show evidence of the femicides occurring in Mexico</li>
                    <li>the matrix of domination, coined by sociologist Patricia Hills Collins to explain how systems of power are created and experienced</li>
                    <li>The Library of Missing Datasets, a project by Mimi Onuoha to highlight the datasets that should exist but do not (often because they aren't going to increase profit or simply aren't thought about from the het white men in power</li>
                    <li>Where Commuters Run Over Black Children on the Pointes-Downtown Track, a powerful visualization produced from data collected in conjunction with Black young adults in Detroit</li>
                    <img class="text-center img-responsive" alt="map of locations where Black children are killed by commuters in Detroit" src="https://resize.pubpub.org/fit-in/800x0/xmwawgc2/21583887685892.jpg"/>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Though I want to avoid "research paralysis," I do have some sources that I hope to examine this semester to supplement my work. These sources include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Algorithms of Oppression by Safiya Umoja Noble</li>
                    <li>Race After Technology by Ruha Benjamin</li>
                    <li>Visualizing Black America by W.E.B. Du Bois</li>
                    <li>the visualization work of Giorgia Lupi, Alberto Lucas López, Shirley Wu, Pablo Robles, and Federica Fragapane</li>
                    <li>the work of research centers like Data&Society, the Berkman Klein Center, and the MIT Data + Feminism Lab</li>
                    <li>the journalistic work at the Markup, ProPublica, and the Pudding</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[One of my favorite visualizations of all time by Giorgia Lupi and Kaki King]</p>
                <br>
                <p>This week I hope to explore what might empathetic visualization look like in a journalism setting. The data was obtained from the University of North Carolina's Center for Innovation and Sustainability in Local Media's Database of Newspapers. This dataset shows the newspapers open in Ohio in the years 2004, 2014, 2016, and 2019. I had cleaned the data in a previous CS class as a practice assignment. I wanted to create a visualization to show the consolidation of local newspapers in Ohio. Thus, my goal was to show the change in the number of newspapers per year and show the change in how many newspapers each owner had. I wanted something that showed connections between papers and owners like a network graph. </p>
                <img src="/img/network_sketch.png" alt="sketch of network graphs">
                <p>While I like the floral undertones of the network graph and the way nodes can "bounce back", it's not very easy to see the changes in network graphs over time. I also wanted something that was a bit more playful. I decided to create something that was a mix between a force directed network graph and a clustered bubble chart. Here's the prototype that I came up with.

<p>I like how the user can move the circles and also get more information if they hover over them. If the user uses the slider, they can see the ownership of Ohio newspapers each available year. I think its pretty fun to interact with.</p>
<p>I user tested this with a friend and realized how dependent the visualization was on the legend. How might I redesign it for people who use screen readers and navigate with keyboards? Additionally, I think there will be the tendency to skip reading the legend and just move to the visualization...in what ways can I integrate better affordances into the design of the visualization?</p>
