                <h1>Week One</h1>
                <p>09.15.20.——sitting in my room in quarantine listening to a playlist of intense throwbacks like Hips Don't Lie by Shakira</p>
                <p>This week, I felt quite nervous about beginning the capstone process. I left our first class feeling absolutely unqualified to be there and terrifed about creating this first prototype.</p> 
                <p>Since the hardest part of something daunting is often starting, I began with reading Data Feminism, a book written by two researchers I respect: Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein. I'm about halfway through, but already find it so helpful in connecting the dots of what I've explored in both my IM and CS classes. Some interesting works that came up:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Los feminicidios en México, a counterdata project by María Salguero to show evidence of the femicides occurring in Mexico</li>
                    <li>the matrix of domination, coined by sociologist Patricia Hills Collins to explain how systems of power are created and experienced</li>
                    <li>The Library of Missing Datasets, a project by Mimi Onuoha to highlight the datasets that should exist but do not (often because they aren't going to increase profit or simply aren't thought about from the het white men in power</li>
                    <li>Where Commuters Run Over Black Children on the Pointes-Downtown Track, a powerful visualization produced from data collected in conjunction with Black young adults in Detroit</li>
                    <img class="text-center img-responsive" alt="map of locations where Black children are killed by commuters in Detroit" src="https://resize.pubpub.org/fit-in/800x0/xmwawgc2/21583887685892.jpg"/>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Though I want to avoid "research paralysis," I do have some sources that I hope to examine this semester to supplement my work. These sources include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Algorithms of Oppression by Safiya Umoja Noble</li>
                    <li>Race After Technology by Ruha Benjamin</li>
                    <li>Visualizing Black America by W.E.B. Du Bois</li>
                    <li>the visualization work of Giorgia Lupi, Alberto Lucas López, Shirley Wu, Pablo Robles, and Federica Fragapane</li>
                    <li>the work of research centers like Data&Society, the Berkman Klein Center, and the MIT Data + Feminism Lab</li>
                    <li>the journalistic work at the Markup, ProPublica, and the Pudding</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[One of my favorite visualizations of all time by Giorgia Lupi and Kaki King]</p>
                <br>
                <p>This week I hope to explore what might empathetic visualization look like in a journalism setting. The data was obtained from the University of North Carolina's Center for Innovation and Sustainability in Local Media's Database of Newspapers. This dataset shows the newspapers open in Ohio in the years 2004, 2014, 2016, and 2019. I had cleaned the data in a previous CS class as a practice assignment. I wanted to create a visualization to show the consolidation of local newspapers in Ohio. Thus, my goal was to show the change in the number of newspapers per year and show the change in how many newspapers each owner had. I wanted something that showed connections between papers and owners like a network graph. </p>
                <img src="/img/network_sketch.png" alt="sketch of network graphs">
                <p>While I like the floral undertones of the network graph and the way nodes can "bounce back", it's not very easy to see the changes in network graphs over time. I also wanted something that was a bit more playful. I decided to create something that was a mix between a force directed network graph and a clustered bubble chart. Here's the prototype that I came up with.

<p>I like how the user can move the circles and also get more information if they hover over them. If the user uses the slider, they can see the ownership of Ohio newspapers each available year. I think its pretty fun to interact with.</p>
<p>I user tested this with a friend and realized how dependent the visualization was on the legend. How might I redesign it for people who use screen readers and navigate with keyboards? Additionally, I think there will be the tendency to skip reading the legend and just move to the visualization...in what ways can I integrate better affordances into the design of the visualization?</p>
